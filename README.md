### Behold, my stuff 🖥️

Hi, I'm Niall Sauvage, a 4th year Integrated Computer Science student at TCD. I'm currently based in Dublin, but I hail from Tramore in the sunny south east. My favourite bit of Computer Science is the really low level stuff, but I love the high-level stuff too.
I will talk your ear off about:

- Maths 📐
- History 📘
- Politics 📋
- Diplomacy and other tabletop and video games 🌍
- Terrible, terrible puns 🤦‍♂️
- How nice Tramore beach is on Summer evenings ☀️

#### So what do I actually do? Well,
- [Here's a fully implemented 32bit microprocessor which was built at the gate level using VHDL](https://github.com/ni-sauvage/CS22022). It's really cool.

- [Here's a full-stack web application that was implemented using Django and utilises Docker and AWS](https://github.com/MaxCunningham19/legal_spellcheck). It does some spellchecking, I led the backend team.

- [Here's a repo that contains stuff related to Compiler Design](https://github.com/ni-sauvage/CS33071). Flex and Bison stuff, very satisfying.

- [A Haskell implementation of a basic calculator](https://github.com/alexandersep/CSU33012-SWENG-ASS1). So good that you can have a heart attack at the keyboard and it'll **still** give you an answer. Also Haskell is great.

- I've collaboratively written and parellelised (using both OpenMP and SSE) a matrix convolution algorithm and bucketsort using SSE. 

- [And what I'm currently working on, a Diplomacy move adjudicator](https://github.com/ni-sauvage/diplomac). If I have time, the plan is to turn it into a web application with Flask and React, but for now we're working on the validator itself.

- [Being a college student, I have experience with Java](https://github.com/ni-sauvage/Algs-Final-Project). For this project, we were given data from the Montréal bus system and told to use appropriate data structures and algorithms to carry out pathfinding and string searching.

- [I also created a file transfer protocol to be run across several Docker containers](https://github.com/ni-sauvage/Networks-Assign-1). The file would be transferred from the worker selected to the client via the server. And believe it or not, it net-works.
  
- I've also done stuff relating to [Assembly and computer architecture](https://github.com/ni-sauvage/CS34021) and [Prolog](https://github.com/ni-sauvage/CS34011).
